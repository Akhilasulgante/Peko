# Peko â€“ Quick Food Ordering Platform

## Project objective(Final project)
This project was built for [CS 5610 Web Class](https://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_fall_2022/)
This is a reiteration over the original project focusing on the Usability and accessibilty of the website
Each of the team members interviewed 3 people to understand user's persepective of the site(Recording link submitted on canvas)

Few of the points that was made sure during this phase:
1. App can be accessed entirely through keyboard
2. App follows a constant color scheme
3. App follows a Typography
4. App does not throw any error when checked with axe deque

### color palette
The primary color of the app is #F5C65D, the app follows the skip gradient palette generated from the [color palette](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23F5C65D&sub=1)
The shade of yellow that is selected as a main color of the app is because of its significance in food delivery app. 

### Typography
The information displayed on this app follows [Roboto font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto), which is a top three fonts that is used in resturant delivery apps on the web
